# My directory

My directory is an XML based directory application for Cisco IP Phones. The application itself runs as a web service. The directory entries can be created in xml format and will be uploaded to the server. My directory application will be subscribed to a Cisco IP Phone as XML based application via a service URL or Service URL buttoon. The application reads, paginates and renders the directory contents from XML files.
